## 🧠 Software Overview

**COMSOL Multiphysics** is a professional simulation solution designed to study complex systems governed by multiple interacting physical effects. It enables users to construct detailed models, run numerical simulations, and evaluate system behavior under realistic conditions within a single Windows-based environment.

The platform is built around a highly adaptable modeling concept, allowing users to define physics through equations, parameters, and boundary conditions. This makes COMSOL suitable for both standard engineering problems and custom research-driven simulations that require full control over model formulation.

With its clear visual workflow and powerful computation engine, COMSOL supports iterative development and experimentation. Users can refine assumptions, test alternative scenarios, and gain deeper insight into coupled physical processes long before physical prototypes are created.
